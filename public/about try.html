<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greeting Everyone🖐,</p>
<p>
  I am learning web programing. 
  <br/>
  Actually, I learned it when I was young, 
  but I never really figure out what they really are😅.
  <br/>
  I know some basic concept, but they always confuse me.
  <br/>
</p>

<p>
    During Covid, I lose my job. 
    <br/>
    Now I got some time, 
    And I like to pick it up. 
    <br/>
    Bescause I feel that things I ran away they always come back to me.
    <br/>
    Hope that I can really understand that, and beat down the demon in my mind😃.

<p>
  Thank you for reading this, welcome to look around.
