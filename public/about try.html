<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greeting Everyone🖐,</p>
<p>
  I am learning web programing. 
  Actually, I learned it when I was young, 
  but I never really figure out what they really are😅.
  I know the basic concept, but they always confuse me.
  During Covid, I lose my job. Now I got some time, 
  I like to pick it up. 
  Bescause I feel that thing I ran away they always come back to me.
  Hope that I can really understand that, and beat down the demon in my mind😃.

  Thank you for reading this, welcome to look around.
